## Getting Started

These instructions will give you heads up on how to get started, architecture flow, implementations using in this project.

### Architecture.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/hngfun/image/upload/v1578931056/Group_23_l51pg7.png)

We decide to adopted ```Clean Architecture``` for our development because of it allow decoupling different units of your code in an organized manner. That way the code gets easier to understand, modify and test. Read more about this [here](https://medium.com/exploring-android/learn-clean-architecture-for-android-at-caster-io-8f1513621c30)


## The project consist of some basic implementations and patterns which includes:

* MVVM architectural approaches for the Presentation layer
* Persistence is handled using [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room)
* Dependency injection using [Dagger Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android#inject-interfaces)
* Orchestration of data flow using [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) looking to move to Kotlin Flow soon
* Network operations with [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
* Unit testing using [Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito)
* [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso) UI tests
* Push Notifications with [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging)
* Managing work is done with [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager)


## Git Workflow

Our gitflow runs in a similar manner to that described in this Atlassian doc. Feature branches and PR's are made off and into the Deploy branch. We should embrace a naming convention that describes the feature or bug fix being implemented. So for features we could have the branch name as ```feature/user-login``` or ```f/user-login``` and ```bug/cors-issue``` or ```b/cors-issue``` for bug fixes. PR's are made for each task or feature implementation, this with the branch naming convention ensures that it would be easier to isolate issues introduced to develop branch or production and restore to working condition without affecting other features.

Once you have pushed to a feature branch, you are required to create Pull Request to the ```deploy``` branch which will be reviewed by other engineers on the team.

We also use Tag for release versioning on Git.

## Naming Conventions
Variable , methods & Classes names must be self descriptive also in camel case.
e.g 
* ```PostActivity``` for class name
* ```fragment_post``` layout file name
* ```tvPostTite``` View id reference
* ```performLogin()``` method name


## Documentation & Comments
We use docs blocks to write description documentation and comment for classess and methods. This should clearly describe it functionality and logic executions.

## Linting
Linting is handled by[ktlint](https://ktlint.github.io/). Click [here](https://ktlint.github.io/) to see common use cases of how to structure your code.

### Installing & Setup

* Clone this project from Bitbucket to your machine
* Import project to Android Studio preferring from v4.0 and above


## Writing tests

Practicing test driven development helps to ensure quality and reliable functionalities. Though we are not writing tests yet, these are the test we should look forward to: 
* **Unit Test(logic test):** This involves testing your logic on the remote, cache, data and presentation layer using Mockito and JUnit.   
* **Instrument test(UI test):** This involves testing the UI components(activty & fragments) using Espresso.

## Deployment

Deployment is handled differently based on build variant.

* **Debug:** Apk is sent via Firebase App Distribution to tester
* **Release:** Apk is sent via Firebase App Distribution to fields agents to download via a link

## To-do
1. Migrate from RxJava to Flow.
2. Writing Unit Tests


## How to contribute effectively
1. Branch out from the develop branch to your feature branch

### Domain Layer
1. Create Model classes for the feature if needed.
2. Add the use case to the neccessary repository interface.
3. Create Usecases for the feature in the `interactors`
4. If the Usecase needs any data to carry out any operation provide a nested param class.

### Data Layer
1. Add remote and cache operations to the `Cache` and `Remote` interface.
2. Add the cache or remote interface implementation to its correct data source classes.
3. Add the implmentation of the domain interface repository in the data

### Presentation layer
- Update use case implementaion in the ViewModel classes

### UI Layer
- Add your UI Implementation as specified in the design
- Use viewmodel to interact with the other layers of the application.
